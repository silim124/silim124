## *Using tech to decentralize everything. Because the future needs fixing.*

Hello! I'm Sieun, the co-founder of **Moonlyt** (Web3) and **Glot** (Web2) and a passionate developer with a knack for DeFi derivatives, MEV, and consumer DApps. My playgrounds are Solidity and Solana, but I also dabble in Go server development. When I'm not coding, you can find me winning hackathons or co-founding Web3 startups.
